//! `Texture` methods.
//!
//! Provides texture creation and rendering methods on [`PixState`].
//!
//! Provided methods:
//!
//! - [`PixState::texture`]: Render a portion of a texture to the current canvas.
//! - [`PixState::texture_transformed`]: Render a transformed portion of a texture to the current
//!   canvas.
//! - [`PixState::create_texture`]: Creates a new texture to render to.
//! - [`PixState::delete_texture`]: Delete a texture.
//! - [`PixState::update_texture`]: Update texture with [u8] [slice] of pixel data.
//! - [`PixState::set_texture_target`]: Target a texture for rendering.
//! - [`PixState::clear_texture_target`]: Clear texture target back to primary canvas for rendering.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! # use pix_engine::prelude::*;
//! # struct App;
//! # impl PixEngine for App {
//! fn on_update(&mut self, s: &mut PixState) -> PixResult<()> {
//!     let texture_id1 = s.create_texture(500, 600, PixelFormat::Rgb)?;
//!     // Does not actually render to the current canvas
//!     s.set_texture_target(texture_id1)?;
//!     s.background(Color::random());
//!     s.text("Rendered texture!")?;
//!     s.clear_texture_target();
//!
//!     // `None` uses PixelFormat::default() which defaults to PixelFormat::Rgba
//!     let texture_id2 = s.create_texture(500, 600, None)?;
//!
//!     // `None` updates the entire texture, pass a Rect<i32> to update a sub-rectangle area
//!     let image = Image::from_file("./some_image.png")?;
//!     let pitch = image.width() as usize;
//!     s.update_texture(texture_id2, None, image.as_bytes(), pitch)?;
//!
//!     // Draw both textures to the current canvas

//!     s.texture(texture_id2, None, rect![500, 0, 500, 600])?;

//!     // These could be stored in `self` to avoid re-creating every frame
